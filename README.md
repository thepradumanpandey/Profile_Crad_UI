ðŸš€ Day 4 of Building a Profile Card UI ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my progress on building a front-end clone of the Myntra website!

Today, I focused on creating a Profile Card, which includes:

A profile picture
Name and job title
Social media icons for Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube 



Created a Profile Card: Designed using CSS and HTML.
